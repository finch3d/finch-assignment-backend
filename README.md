# Backend Assignment

Create a simple REST based API that supports the following requirements:
- A REST endpoint to do auto-complete queries of managers
- Match only the beginning of firstname or lastname or segment in email
- Support pagination, i.e. it should be possible to fetch a page/subset of all managers at a time.

Use the data available here: https://gist.github.com/kretz/ac01d631029a61812a023792a41215e2

## Notes

- Use JavaScript/TypeScript and Node.js.
- We'd love to see a service that's as helpful as possible for the end-user, so consider how to deliver the most valuable result.
- You can use frameworks or libraries of your choice.
- A big part of what we're interested in is your architecture and tooling choices, but it's OK to use the provided JSON file as-is in your solution if you want to focus on something else.
- Put all of it in a git repo, with instructions on how to run.
- Add README with notes you want to share, e.g.
  * important design decisions
  * assumptions
  * things that you wanted to do but had no time to do
  * things you would do differently if this was in production
  * things you tried but did not work out
  * changes in other code/apis you would like to have
  * ...

Good luck!
